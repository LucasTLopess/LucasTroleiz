I am passionate about life, for example, waking up next to the one I love, as well as looking at the infinite shades of green in a forest, the different colors of the sky in summer, the codes running on my computer during my work, the guitar I play during my break and knowing that all of this has a beginning and that everything happens for a purpose.
